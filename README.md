# PyLuminescence

A simple GUI with sound output to control sonoluminescence systems.

---------------------

Sonoluminescence is an interesting phenomenon in which certain conditions can make water glow. If you're here, you probably know all about it. Let's dive in.

**The minimum required hardware setup:**

This is essentially the easiest possible sonoluminescent setup. I've drawn inspiration from the setups at techmind.org/sl as well as my own experience in sonoluminesce to create the simplest and lowest entry cost setup.

Required parts (total cost ~$40, no/minimal soldering required):

* A 25khz, ~60W piezo power transducer ([Reference transducer](http://www.ebay.com/itm/60W-25KHz-Ultrasonic-Piezoelectric-Transducer-Cleaner-Medical-Beauty-/161346061040?hash=item2590f982f0:g:9QQAAOSw3ydVzhOu)) 
* A >7w audio amplifier capable of outputting at 23khz at a reasonable power (most can, [reference part](https://www.canakit.com/5w-audio-amplifier-kit-ck153-uk153.html)). Even a stereo system amp should work.
* A 5-12v to 120v ~2amp transformer. This will be used to drive the transducer. [Reference part](http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Hammond/166K6B/?qs=%2fha2pyFaduicWE%252bPDHDp88Z74tQbXOB3gxOnro9YHf4%3d)
* A 150ml flask, round/round-bottomed/spherical,distillation/boiling. [Reference.](https://www.amazon.ca/213L12-Karter-Scientific-Florence-Boiling/dp/B006VYY3UC/ref=sr_1_1?s=industrial&ie=UTF8&qid=1472616089&sr=1-1&keywords=150ml+round+bottom)
* A small piezo disk.
* An airtight mason jar.
* Distilled water.
* Epoxy.
* A small dropper or syringe.
